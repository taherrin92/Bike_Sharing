## Summary
The purpose of this challenge is to provide details about user bike trips. In order to provide as detailed information as possible, the trip duration column in the csv had to be converted into a datetime type in seconds before the csv could be uploaded into Tableau. This allowed Tableau to treat the column as a time object, and not as an integer. Heatmaps and graphs could then be plotted providing details into user bike trips.

## Results
Most users have an under 30 minute bike trip duration. The user stop time heatmap shows that most of the bike trips occur at the start and end of a work day (8am and 5pm Mon-Fri) and used on the weekends between 10am and 7pm. When the checkout times and trips by weekday hour are broken up by gender, the majority of users are male, with checkout times following the same pattern. Users with subscriptions checkout bikes more often than paying per use. Males tend to use the service more than females and users are more likely to input their information when they are subscribing, as most unknown users pay per use.
